# Dodgy-Webscraper
Just a dodgy little Webscraper

Simple Webscraper using proxies and random user-agents - for educational purposes only!<br />
Do not use this code on websites if you are not authorized to do so. <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind:<br />
Obfuscating your user-agent may be considered a violation of a website's terms of service, 
Additionally, certain uses of user agent spoofing, such as scraping content or automating clicks on ads, 
may be considered illegal in some cases.

Many websites have terms of service that prohibit web scraping, and they may take legal action against individuals or companies that engage in web scraping without permission. It is important to check a website's terms of service before engaging in web scraping, and to obtain permission when necessary.

Some laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in USA, have specific provisions regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information obtained by scraping.
